# YWCC-307
This README serves as this repository's cover page.

This repository consists of my individual presentation from YWCC 307 and the course's syllabus.
The presentation is about managing non-traditional software teams.
In this presentation I go over the general phases of the software development lifecyle. 
I then shift focus on two different software development lifecycle models: Waterfall and Agile and then talk about the main differences between the two.
I also go over the pros and cons of the two lifecyle models and explain why Agile is now the industry de facto in software development.
Additionally, I talk about the 6 steps in Agile methodologies from a project manager's perspective and the scrum framework used in agile development.
I then shift focus to talk about agile methodolgies from a software developer's perspective. 
Lastly, I conclude the presentation with a summary on how using Agile methodolgies helps to deliver a better product and how it helps with team productivity
and the products overall quality.

The second part of this repository consists of YWCC 307 group project. We are Team 10 and our prompt was: Your team is involved in designing a new cryptocurrency for a sovereign client. You have been asked to evaluate Ethereum as a contender of bitcoin for the basis of your currency. What does your team think and would suggest as your teamâ€™s choice to your client?

Here you will find our team's meeting minutes, presentation/product, and research to create the presentation.
