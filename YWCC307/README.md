This is the cover page for YWCC 307 group 10's group project.
We were assigned project #5 which is:
Your team is involved in designing a new cryptocurrency for a sovereign client. You have been asked to evaluate Ethereum as a contender of bitcoin for the basis of your currency. What does your team think and would suggest as your team’s choice to your client?

We will be submitting our github repository. Each repository should have:

Your finished product/document
Your process, especially documentation for each team meeting
Summary of your research and/or intermediate work products

Your team project(product/document) presentation should be inclusive of all three items.

The project will be graded as follows.

The top half of the table above will be used to derive a group grade. This part of your grade will be the same for each member of your group. The bottom elements (last two) will be based on your individual performance and the evaluation of your teammates.

The weekly documentation of the team’s meetings will be graded separately.
